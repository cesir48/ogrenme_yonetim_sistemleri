It makes use of custom menus that appear above the site title on every page, giving it a user friendly structure. It comes in a variety of colors and is designed to provide a lower contrast interface for reading while maintaining clear visibility.  It also includes a basic settings page allowing you to change your custom logo, link color, add a tagline above the site name on the front page, and add text to the footer.</p><h2>Parents</h2><p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you wish to modify aspects of this theme beyond the settings offered, we advise creating a new  theme using this theme, Base and Canvas all as parents so updates to any of those themes in the core will find their way into your new theme.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme is based on fusion themes, it was originally created by Digital Nature(hello@digitalnature.ro) before being ported to Moodle by Patrick Malley (patrick@newschoollearning.com). Sharp was created by 3i Logic.</div></div>";s:9:"linkcolor";s:10:"Link Color";s:13:"linkcolordesc";s:39:"This sets the link color for the theme.";s:13:"gradientstart";s:20:"Gradient Start Color";s:17:"gradientstartdesc";s:71:"This sets the block area background gradient start color for the theme.";s:11:"gradientend";s:18:"Gradient End Color";s:15:"gradientenddesc";s:69:"This sets the block area background gradient end color for the theme.";s:8:"buttonbg";s:17:"Button Background";s:12:"buttonbgdesc";s:46:"This sets the button background for the theme.";s:11:"buttoncolor";s:21:"Font Color for Button";s:15:"buttoncolordesc";s:47:"This sets the buttons font color for the theme.";s:16:"buttonhovercolor";s:19:"Font Color on hover";s:20:"buttonhovercolordesc";s:56:"This sets the buttons font color on hover for the theme.";s:11:"configtitle";s:14:"sharp settings";s:9:"customcss";s:10:"Custom CSS";s:13:"customcssdesc";s:96:"Any CSS you enter here will be added to every page allowing your to easily customise this theme.";s:7:"tagline";s:7:"Tagline";s:11:"taglinedesc";s:76:"A short tagline to be displayed under the site name on the front page.<br />";s:10:"footertext";s:10:"Footertext";s:14:"footertextdesc";s:30:"Set a footnote or footer text.";}
